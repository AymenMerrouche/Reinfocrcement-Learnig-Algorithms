Main Reinforment Learning Algorithms Illustrated in Different gym Envrionments (python and PyTorch)
This repository contains main RL algorithms illustrated on differnet gym games (GridWolrd, LunarLander, CartPole). This work was done with my fellow student **Hakim Chekirou** as part of the course [link to course's web page](https://dac.lip6.fr/master/rladl/ "**RLADL : Reinforcement Learning and advanced Deep Learning**") while pursuing a master's degree in machine learning and statistics at Sorbonne University - [link to master's web page](https://m2a.lip6.fr/description/ "**M2 Apprentissage et Algorithmes (M2A)**").
