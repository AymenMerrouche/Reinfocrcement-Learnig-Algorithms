Main Reinforment Learning Algorithms Illustrated in Different gym Envrionments (python and PyTorch) <br>

This repository contains main RL algorithms illustrated on differnet gym envrionments (GridWolrd, LunarLander, CartPole). <br>
This work was done with my fellow student **Hakim Chekirou** as part of the course [**RLADL : Reinforcement Learning and advanced Deep Learning**](https://dac.lip6.fr/master/rladl/ "**RLADL : Reinforcement Learning and advanced Deep Learning**") while pursuing a master's degree in machine learning and statistics at Sorbonne University - [**M2 Apprentissage et Algorithmes (M2A)**](https://m2a.lip6.fr/description/ "**M2 Apprentissage et Algorithmes (M2A)**").
