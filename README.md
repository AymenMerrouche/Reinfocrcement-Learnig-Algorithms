Main Reinforment Learning Algorithms Illustrated in Different gym Envrionments (python and PyTorch) <br>

This repository contains main RL algorithms illustrated on differnet gym envrionments (GridWolrd, LunarLander, CartPole). <br>
This work was done with my colleague **Hakim Chekirou** as part of the course [**RLADL : Reinforcement Learning and advanced Deep Learning**](https://dac.lip6.fr/master/rladl/ "**RLADL : Reinforcement Learning and advanced Deep Learning**") while pursuing a master's degree in machine learning and statistics at Sorbonne University - [**M2 Apprentissage et Algorithmes (M2A)**](https://m2a.lip6.fr/description/ "**M2 Apprentissage et Algorithmes (M2A)**"). <br>
Theoretical considerations, empirical results and analysis are to be found in this [**report**](./Reports_RLD_practical_sessions.pdf "**practical sessions report**") (french).

# Explored Alogorithms :
## tme1 : Multi-Armed Bandits : Exploration vs Exploitation.
## tme2 : Policy Iteration and Value Iteration.
## tme3 : Q-Learning, SARSA (state–action–reward–state–action) and Dyna-Q.
## tme4 : DQN.
## tme5 : Actor-Critic.
## tme6 : PPO (Proximal Policy Optimisation) with adaptative KL, PPO with clipped Objective and PPO with Entropy cost.
## tme8 : DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient).
## tme11 : MADDPG (Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient).
## tme-12-13 : Behavioral Cloning and GAIL (Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning).
## tme14 : Goal DQN and HER (Hindsight Experience Replay).
